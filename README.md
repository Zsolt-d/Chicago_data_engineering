# Data analysis of Chicagi taxi trips
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze Chicago taxi trips data alongside weather data to uncover insights and patterns. The data includes details such as trip miles, total fare, company, payment type, and pickup and dropoff locations, and it is combined with weather data from a separate API to provide a comprehensive view of taxi usage in different weather conditions.
